    description: Because of our high standards and donation requirements, less than
      1% of applicants will make it into our donor portfolio due to our high
      standards and program requirements, based on screening requirements and those
      who don't move forward in the program. That means you’ll have access to one of
      the largest, most rigorously screened, diverse selection of donors in the
      world.
