    #### Diverse donor selection
    
    Because of our high standards and donation requirements, less than 1% of applicants will make it into our donor portfolio due to our high standards and program requirements, based on screening requirements and those who don't move forward in the program. That means you’ll have access to one of the largest, most rigorously screened, diverse selection of donors in the world.
